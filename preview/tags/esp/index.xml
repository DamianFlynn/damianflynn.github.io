&lt;p&gt;So, with a few failed attempts and a lot of patching samples together; I have a stable running implementation which you can clone or fork to get up and running quickly with your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>NodeMCU Pinouts</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/preview/posts/nodemcu-pinouts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/preview/posts/nodemcu-pinouts/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the past year, I have been using a tiny board, known as the &lt;strong&gt;NodeMCU&lt;/strong&gt; which is essentially a developer board for a module know as the &lt;strong&gt;ESP8266&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;NodeMCU&lt;/strong&gt; is formed by an &lt;strong&gt;ESP12E&lt;/strong&gt;, which still has an &lt;strong&gt;ESP8266EX&lt;/strong&gt; inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="img-4d0d2e1c-NodeMCU_ESP12E.jpg" alt="Image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This device is really nice to work with, it is supplied preconfigured with a Micro USB input, for both programming and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term NodeMCU usually refers to the firmware, while the board is called Devkit. NodeMCU Devkit 1.0 consists of an ESP-12E on a board, along with a voltage regulator, a USB interface.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
