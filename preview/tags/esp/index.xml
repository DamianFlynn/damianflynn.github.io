&lt;p>So, with a few failed attempts and a lot of patching samples together; I have a stable running implementation which you can clone or fork to get up and running quickly with your own projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NodeMCU Pinouts</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/preview/posts/nodemcu-pinouts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/preview/posts/nodemcu-pinouts/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past year, I have been using a tiny board, known as the &lt;strong>NodeMCU&lt;/strong> which is essentially a developer board for a module know as the &lt;strong>ESP8266&lt;/strong>. The &lt;strong>NodeMCU&lt;/strong> is formed by an &lt;strong>ESP12E&lt;/strong>, which still has an &lt;strong>ESP8266EX&lt;/strong> inside it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img-4d0d2e1c-NodeMCU_ESP12E.jpg" alt="Image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This device is really nice to work with, it is supplied preconfigured with a Micro USB input, for both programming and power.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The term NodeMCU usually refers to the firmware, while the board is called Devkit. NodeMCU Devkit 1.0 consists of an ESP-12E on a board, along with a voltage regulator, a USB interface.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
