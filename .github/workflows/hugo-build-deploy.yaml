# Hugo Build and Deploy Workflow
# 
# This workflow handles the building and deployment of both production and preview versions
# of a Hugo website that uses Go modules. It supports multiple build triggers and environments.
#
# DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS:
# 1. Production Only: When manually triggered with 'production' environment
#    - Builds production site (excludes drafts)
#    - Deploys to root of gh-pages branch (clearing previous content)
#
# 2. Preview Only: When manually triggered with 'preview' environment 
#    - Builds preview site (includes drafts, expired and future content)
#    - Deploys to /preview/ subdirectory in gh-pages branch
#    - Preserves existing content in gh-pages using keep_files: true
#
# 3. Both Production and Preview (push/schedule/webhook triggers):
#    - Production builds and deploys first (clears gh-pages branch)
#    - Preview builds and deploys second to /preview/ subdirectory
#    - Preview preserves production content via keep_files: true
#
# JOB DEPENDENCIES:
# - Preview has a 'needs' dependency on production to ensure proper ordering when both run
# - If production is skipped, preview still runs (GitHub Actions allows this behavior)
#
# GITHUB ENVIRONMENTS:
# This workflow uses GitHub Environments for deployment management:
# - 'production': For the main site deployment
#   - Configure at: Settings > Environments > New environment > Name: production
#   - Can be configured with required reviewers, wait timers, and branch rules
# - 'preview': For the preview/draft content deployment
#   - Configure at: Settings > Environments > New environment > Name: preview
#   - URL is set to the preview deployment URL for easy access from GitHub UI
#
# Each environment can have its own protection rules and environment-specific secrets if needed.
