# Hugo Build and Deploy Workflow
# 
# This workflow handles the building and deployment of both production and preview versions
# of a Hugo website that uses Go modules. It supports multiple build triggers and environments.
#
# GITHUB ENVIRONMENTS:
# This workflow uses GitHub Environments for deployment management:
# - 'production': For the main site deployment
#   - Configure at: Settings > Environments > New environment > Name: production
#   - Can be configured with required reviewers, wait timers, and branch rules
# - 'preview': For the preview/draft content deployment
#   - Configure at: Settings > Environments > New environment > Name: preview
#   - URL is set to the preview deployment URL for easy access from GitHub UI
#
# Each environment can have its own protection rules and environment-specific secrets if needed.
