 &lt;div id="wordpress" class="absolute -top-28"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 Wordpress
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of Wordpress, this was a standard core feature, which leveraged the fact that the pages were rendered on demand from a backend database. In this scenario, the same approach is offered to maintain a commenting platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using pipelines for flow static site content between markdown and foundation</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/using-pipelines-for-flow-static-site-content-between-markdown-and-foundation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/using-pipelines-for-flow-static-site-content-between-markdown-and-foundation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With the heavy lifting done in creating the site building mechanics and a solid foundation to build and share upon; our final objective is to automate the process of connecting these two stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="relative text-5xl font-semibold leading-tense text-secondary-500 mb-4 -ml-px" id="release-pipeline"&gt;&lt;a href="#release-pipeline" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'Release Pipeline'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;div id="release-pipeline" class="absolute -top-28"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 Release Pipeline
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically the goal we are speaking about is the &lt;strong&gt;Release Pipeline&lt;/strong&gt; which will take the artefact &lt;em&gt;(our site .ZIP file)&lt;/em&gt; that we created in the &lt;strong&gt;Build Pipeline&lt;/strong&gt; in our previous topic &lt;a href="https://damianflynn.github.io/Building-The-Site/" rel=""&gt;Constructing a new Home with Jekyll and Azure DevOps&lt;/a&gt;; and publish this to our storage account.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Laying the foundation in Azure for a Static Site</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/laying-the-foundation-in-azure-for-a-static-site/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/laying-the-foundation-in-azure-for-a-static-site/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hosting my site on Wordpress was not super complex; I leveraged the Azure PaaS Services for Web Apps, and orginally the 3rd party support for hosted MySQL database’s. Once I was up and running I quickly realised that all media hosted on the site were landing on the webserver, so a plugin from its marketplace offered the ability to relocate the media to an Azure Blob; offloading some of the challanges.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Constructing a new Home with Jekyll and Azure DevOps</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/constructing-a-new-home-with-jekyll-and-azure-devops/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/constructing-a-new-home-with-jekyll-and-azure-devops/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the unspoken truths behind the lack of posts in recent history was due to a few bugs, which in the end resulted in an experience where from home it appeared that any new content was published and working; but outside this fortress in the real world, there was a large silence echoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really only discovered this issue in May of this year, and was, to say the least, a little agitated with the situation and decided then to change the approach to how I save my notes and share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
