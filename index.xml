            &lt;/div>Learn how to deploy a fully integrated Node-RED environment inside a K3s Kubernetes cluster on an Azure Arc-connected edge device. This guide walks you through namespace setup, persistent storage, service exposure, and secure access over SSH tunnels. Simulate MQTT and Modbus devices, visualize flows, and forward real-time telemetry to Azure MQ and OPC UA—all without opening firewall ports. Ideal for industrial IoT scenarios needing secure hybrid connectivity and local processing.</description></item><item><title>IoT - Azure Arc Connected K3s</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/iot-azure-arc-connected-k3s/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:24:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>damian</name></author><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/iot-azure-arc-connected-k3s/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

AI, now a pivotal component, optimizes the entire lifecycle of cloud architecture, enhancing tasks like deployment, maintenance, and scaling. This article explores the role of AI in empowering cloud architecture and deployments, especially when combined with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Bicep and Terraform.</description></item><item><title>Bicep - Tags as Parameters</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/bicep-tags-as-parameters/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/bicep-tags-as-parameters/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

<p>In a post earlier, we look at using arm to lookup the value of tags&rsquo; at both the Subscription and Resource Level.</p>
<p>With Bicep this is much easier to understand. This is the same lab configuration as in the original post, but this time to code should be a lot more readable.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Streaming Vinyl On Sonos</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/streaming-vinyl-on-sonos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/streaming-vinyl-on-sonos/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

<p>In the post, I am going to introduce a concept which will allow you to greatly up your Infrastructure as Code game, by using Azure as a State Machine!</p>
<p>One of the typical challenges when deploying ARM templates, is the sheer number of parameters which we find as a requirement to complete a deployment; which as you will appreciate gets considerably harder as we target many environments.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Change Detection Using Oxidized</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/change-detection-using-oxidized/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/change-detection-using-oxidized/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>Oxidized is a Linux based service which has the ability to monitor a device’s configuration, including software and hardware. Current configuration is backed up from each device and stored to a GIT repository to maintain history of changes.</p>
<p>The process is very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to each device in the router list router.db,</li>
<li>Run Commands to get the information that will be saved</li>
<li>Clean the output</li>
<li>Commit the Changes to GIT Repository
The tool is coded in <em>Ruby</em>, and implements a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for interaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, there is a Web based User experience included in the solution so we can get a fast overview of the world.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Azure Enterprise Agreement Delegation</title><link>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/azure-enterprise-agreement-delegation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://damianflynn.github.io/posts/azure-enterprise-agreement-delegation/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
