# My Privacy Statement


### This is my personal and nonprofit blog: Damian Flynn – ‘Making Incredible Technology, Incredibly Simple.’

My website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and modern static site generator, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can find out more about me at https://www.damianflynn.com/about.

## What personal data I collect

As a static site, I don’t have a backend or database, and I don’t actively collect personal data. However, I do use some third-party services—like analytics or comment systems—which may gather limited information to help me understand how people use the site and to improve your experience.

I don’t sell or share your data with anyone.

## Comments

If you leave a comment (when commenting is enabled), any data you enter—such as your name, email address, and comment—is submitted to a third-party service (like Disqus or GitHub Issues, depending on the setup). These services may collect additional technical data such as your IP address and browser details to help reduce spam.

For example, if I use Gravatar, your email hash may be shared to fetch an avatar image. Gravatar’s privacy policy is here: https://automattic.com/privacy.

## Media

If you upload images through forms (if available), avoid including embedded location data (EXIF). Visitors may be able to extract this data from images displayed on the site.

## Contact Forms

If you contact me through a form (or linked external service), the data you provide is used solely to respond to your message. I do not store or reuse this information beyond the purpose of that communication.

## Cookies

This site itself does not set cookies, but embedded services (like YouTube, Twitter, or Google Analytics) may use them to track activity or remember preferences. You can manage or block cookies in your browser settings.

## Embedded Content from Other Sites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (like videos or social media posts). This content behaves exactly as if you visited the original website, which may collect data, use cookies, or track your interaction—even if you’re logged into that service.

## Analytics

I use **Google Analytics** to understand traffic and usage patterns. This helps me improve the site content and performance. Google may collect anonymized data such as IP addresses and browser type.

You can read Google’s privacy policy here: https://policies.google.com/privacy, and opt out of tracking via browser extensions or by disabling cookies.

## Social Media Integrations

Social features (like sharing buttons or embedded posts from platforms such as Facebook or Twitter) may track your interaction and link your visit to your account on those platforms if you’re logged in.

You can manage these settings in your social media accounts or avoid interactions while logged in.

## Who I share your data with

I don’t share or sell your data. However, third-party services I use may collect data independently. These include:

- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting provider (see [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement))
- **Google Analytics** – Website analytics
- **Facebook/Twitter** – If embedded content or share buttons are used
- **Disqus or other comment tools** – If enabled

## How long I retain your data

Since this is a static site, no data is stored by me directly. If you interact via a third-party service (like comments), data retention is handled by that platform according to their policies.

## What rights you have over your data

You can request that any personal data submitted to third-party services (e.g., Disqus) be removed, or you can manage your data via those services’ own dashboards and settings.

## Where your data goes

If commenting is available, comment data may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

## How I protect your data

Although my site is static and does not store data directly, I ensure that the services I use are secure and trustworthy. I keep all content and dependencies up to date and use HTTPS to protect your connection while browsing.
